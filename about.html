	Our approach is rooted in years of on-the-ground experience, driven by a careful methodology and powered by a deep passion to improve the lives of children and give them a chance to grow up in a family.

    We believe in collaboration as we know this work is bigger than any one organization. We are part of a global network of nonprofit organizations leading the worldwide movement.

    Our mission is to help the poor children survive in miserable and helpless situation by raising funds through donation camp . The procedure could be either digitally or in offline mode through camps and various events organised locally.
	We have been authenticated by Sparks Foundation and verified through it's terms and conditions. There is no personal and private profitable intensions to do this mission despite it has been willingly initiated to devote the service to the society.
	We appreciate all efforts and good intentions who wants to make this mission to be successful.
